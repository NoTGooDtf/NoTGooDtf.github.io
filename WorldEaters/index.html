  <h1>World Eaters 40k Helper</h1>
  
  <p>
      Clad in crimson and brass they come, a tidal wave of boundless fury. They are without restraint, without mercy or fear. They are wrath incarnate, takers 
      of skulls, reavers with an insatiable lust for blood. </br>
      They are the World Eaters </br>
      Blood for the Blood God. Skulls for the Skull Throne.

      <h4>Detachment Rule - Rush to the Fray</h4>
      <p>
        Each time a World Eaters unit from your army disembarks from a Transport, until the end of the turn, add 1 to Charge rolls made for that unit and that unit's melee weapons have the [Lance] ability.
      </p>
      <h4>Enhancements</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Murderous Onslaught - World Eaters model only. If the bearer's unit disembarked from a Transport this turn, until the end of the turn, enemy units cannot use the Fire Overwatch Stratagem to shoot at the bearer's unit.</p></li>
        <li><p>Aggresive Deployment - World Eaters model only. In the Declare Battle Formations step, if the bearer starts the battle embarked within a Dedicated Transport, that Dedicated Transport has the Scouts 9" ability.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unleash Hell - World Eaters model only. At the start of your Shooting phase, you can select one Vehicle model within 6" of the bearer or, if the bearer is embarked within a Transport, you can select that Transport model. Until the end of the phase, after the selected model has shot, select one enemy unit hit by one or more of those attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that enemy unit is suppressed. While a unit is suppressed, each time a model in that unit makes an attack, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.</p></li>
        <li><p>Infernal Infusion - World Eaters model only. Once per battle, at the start of the FIght phase, the bearer can use this Enhancement. If it does, until the end of the phase, the bearer's unit has the Fights First ability.</p></li>
